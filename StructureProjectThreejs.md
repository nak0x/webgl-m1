## Introduction [00:00](#)[](#introduction)

To this point, all the exercises have been small enough to fit into a single JavaScript file without struggling too much. We've separated the different parts of our code by using block comments, and we've scrolled a lot.

But real-life projects tend to have much more code. Having everything as tangled as spaghetti in one file soon becomes an issue. For example:

*   It's hard to find what you want.
*   It's hard to re-use specific parts.
*   You need to make sure that variables are not in conflict with other variables.
*   If you work with other developers, you'll have a lot of conflicts on that file.
*   You'll start to have cramps in your fingers because you have to scroll so much.
*   Etc.

We need a way to structure our code in a more maintainable way.

Though this course is dedicated to Three.js, we are going to learn JavaScript concepts like classes and modules for this lesson. They will become very handy when it comes to organizing our code.

In the following parts of the lesson, I will show you how I (Bruno Simon) like to organize my code. This is based on very personal preferences that you might not agree with, and you might be right. Don't hesitate to create your own structure and only take what you think is good from the following advice.

In the rest of the course, for simplicity's sake and in case some of you are not comfortable with what you will learn here, we won't be using the structure presented in this lesson. We will keep coding all the JavaScript in one file (spaghetti style). But if you feel comfortable trying the new structure in this lesson, you can adapt the following lessons to the new way or to your own structure.

## Modules [02:32](#)[](#modules)

Modules are one of the most important features used to structure our code. The idea is to separate our code into multiple files and import those files when we need them.

We actually already use modules when we import dependencies like this:

```javascript
import * as THREE from 'three'
import gsap from 'gsap'
```

But this time, we are going to import our own code.

### Compatibility[](#compatibility)

When using Vite, all our imports are merged into one file that will work on most browsers. This way, we don't even have to worry about the compatibility of modules.

Furthermore, modules are now natively supported by most modern browsers without using a bundler. But, we aren't going to use that native support for a couple of reasons:

*   Not all browsers are compatible with it ([Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/?search=import)).
*   We already need Vite for other reasons like NPM dependencies, shader files integration (later in the course), local server, etc. And modules are natively supported by Vite.

### Syntax[](#syntax)

We are going to ignore the current state of our project for a moment to focus on syntax.

In `/src/script.js`, comment out everything (even the CSS import).

In the `/src/` folder, create a `test.js` file. We are going to add content to that file and import it into `script.js`.

A file can export one or multiple things, but, to keep things simple, I like to export only one thing per file.

To do that, write the following code in `test.js` :

```javascript
export default 'Hello modules'
```

And then, to import this code into `/src/script.js`, write the following code:

```javascript
import test from './test.js'

console.log(test)
```

And that's it. Check your console and you should see `Hello modules`.

One very important detail is that the path starts with `./`. When we refer to a file, we need to do it that way, otherwise the build tool will try to find it in the `node_modules` folder.

Here, we exported a string, which is not very useful. But we can export functions:

```javascript
// test.js
export default () =>
{
    console.log('Hello modules')
}

// scripts.js
import test from './test.js'

test()
```

We can also export objects:

```javascript
// test.js
export default {
    hello: 'modules'
}

// scripts.js
import test from './test.js'

console.log(test)
```

And we can also export classes, but we are going to see that later.

The `export` instruction can also be done after the object:

```javascript
// test.js
const somethingToExport = {
    hello: 'modules'
}

export default somethingToExport
```

And as I said earlier, one file can export multiple things:

```javascript
// test.js
const oneThing = {
    hello: 'modules'
}

const anotherThing = () =>
{
    console.log('Hi!')
}

export { oneThing, anotherThing }

// scripts.js
import { oneThing, anotherThing } from './test.js'

console.log(oneThing)
anotherThing()
```

By exporting multiple things, we don't need to import everything in the module. We can select what we want:

```javascript
// script.js
import { oneThing } from './test.js'

console.log(oneThing)
```

And this is actually how Three.js classes can be imported without importing the whole library.

Currently, when we import Three.js, we do:

```javascript
import * as THREE from 'three'
```

And everything that is being exported from `three` will be available in the `THREE` variable. But we could have imported specific classes like this:

```javascript
import { SphereGeometry } from 'three'
```

But again, we are not going to use that feature and each one of our files is going to export only one thing.

## Classes [14:15](#)[](#classes)

Now that we know how to separate our code into multiple files, what should we export and import exactly?

We are going to use classes for exporting and importing. Classes allow us to use **Object-Oriented Programming** in JavaScript.

### Compatibility[](#compatibility-1)

Classes are supported by most browsers ([Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/es6-class)), so we can use them without trouble.

### Creating a class[](#creating-a-class)

Remove the code related to modules (even the `test.js` file) and leave the rest of the code commented. We are going to focus on the classes now.

To create a class, use the following syntax in `/src/script.js`:

```javascript
class HelloClass {}
```

If you test this code now, nothing will happen because our class is currently empty and we haven't used it anywhere else in our code. But, in the classes in the example below, we are going to put some code between the `{}`.

Also, you should note that class names, by convention, usually use the **PascalCase** where the first letter of each word is in uppercase.

### Instantiating the class[](#instantiating-the-class)

A class is like a blueprint. We can use that blueprint to create an object. We can also use that blueprint to create multiple objects.

Let's imagine that our class is a blueprint to create a robot:

```javascript
class Robot {}
```

To create a robot from that blueprint, we would need to write this:

```javascript
const robot = new Robot()
console.log(robot)
```

And that's it. Though this class does nothing and thus our `robot` variable does nothing, we created a robot out of our `Robot` class.

The `robot` variable is what we call an **instance** of the class.

As already noted, we can also create multiple instances of that class:

```javascript
class Robot {}

const wallE = new Robot()
const ultron = new Robot()
const astroBoy = new Robot()
```

All of those robots will be based on the same class.

### Methods[](#methods)

That's cute, but our robots can't do anything. We can add functions to our robots like this:

```javascript
class Robot
{
    sayHi()
    {
        console.log('Hello!')
    }
}
```

Functions inside of a class are called **methods** and every instance of the class will have these methods.

Now, each one of our robots can say "hi".

```javascript
ultron.sayHi()
astroBoy.sayHi()
```

But how impolite it is for those robots to not say "thank you" to their creator for being created!

If you add a method named `constructor` to the class, this method will be called automatically when instantiated:

```javascript
class Robot
{
    constructor()
    {
        console.log('Thank you creator')
    }

    sayHi()
    {
        console.log('Hello!')
    }
}
```

Now, every robot being created with this class will say "Thank you creator" automatically when instantiated.

We can also provide parameters to that `constructor`.

To illustrate that, we are going to give a name to each one of the robots:

```javascript
const wallE = new Robot('Wall-E')
const ultron = new Robot('Ultron')
const astroBoy = new Robot('Astro Boy')
```

And to retrieve those names in the class, we can add the parameter to the `constructor` function:

```javascript
class Robot
{
    constructor(name)
    {
        console.log(`I am ${name}. Thank you creator`)
    }

    sayHi()
    {
        console.log('Hello!')
    }
}
```

### Context[](#context)

But what if we also want the robot to provide his name when saying "hi"?

We already sent the name to the constructor and we don't want to send it again to the `sayHi` function. What we want is for the robot to remember his name.

We can do that with `this`. Write the following code:

```javascript
class Robot
{
    constructor(name)
    {
        this.name = name

        console.log(`I am ${this.name}. Thank you creator`)
    }

    sayHi()
    {
        console.log('Hello!')
    }
}
```

`this` is what we call the `context`. Though the class is the same for each instance, the context will be different for every instances of the class.

In our case, `this` will be the robot itself.

`this` is accessible in every method which is why we can now retrieve the name of the robot in the `sayHi` function:

```javascript
class Robot
{
    // ...

    sayHi()
    {
        console.log(`Hello! My name is ${this.name}`)
    }
}
```

`name` is what we call a property of the class. We can add more properties:

```javascript
class Robot
{
    constructor(name, legs)
    {
        this.name = name
        this.legs = legs

        console.log(`I am ${this.name}. Thank you creator`)
    }

    // ...
}

const wallE = new Robot('Wall-E', 0)
const ultron = new Robot('Ultron', 2)
const astroBoy = new Robot('Astro Boy', 2)
```

We can also access properties from the instance outside of the class:

```javascript
// ...

const wallE = new Robot('Wall-E', 0)
const ultron = new Robot('Ultron', 2)
const astroBoy = new Robot('Astro Boy', 2)

console.log(wallE.legs)
```

Methods are also available from the context and we can ask the robot to say "hi" automatically in the `constructor`:

```javascript
class Robot
{
    constructor(name, legs)
    {
        this.name = name
        this.legs = legs

        this.sayHi()

        console.log(`I am ${this.name}. Thank you creator`)
    }

    // ...
}
```

### Inheritance[](#inheritance)

Inheritance is like creating a class based on another class. In a way, we create a blueprint based on another blueprint.

All the methods of the base class will be available in the new class.

To illustrate that, let's add a feature to our robots so that they can fly. But not every robot can fly like Wall-E. Still, every robot needs a name and legs.

To create a class based on another, use the `extends` keyword. Create the following class after the `Robot` class:

```javascript
class FlyingRobot extends Robot
{
    
}
```

We have created a `FlyingRobot` class which we can now use for robots that can fly:

```javascript
const wallE = new Robot('Wall-E', 0)
const ultron = new FlyingRobot('Ultron', 2)
const astroBoy = new FlyingRobot('Astro Boy', 2)
```

Currently, this `FlyingRobot` doesn't add anything to the `Robot` class, but we can add methods like this:

```javascript
class FlyingRobot extends Robot
{
    takeOff()
    {
        console.log(`Have a good flight ${this.name}`)
    }

    land()
    {
        console.log(`Welcome back ${this.name}`)
    }
}
```

Robots instantiated with `FlyingRobot` will still be able to say "hi", but now they will also be able to take off and land:

```javascript
astroBoy.sayHi()
astroBoy.takeOff()
astroBoy.land()
```

But if we try to do the same with Wall-E:

```javascript
wallE.takeOff()
```

We get an error. Wall-E isn't an instance of `FlyingRobot` and thus can't take off.

Providing a method with the same name to the `FlyingRobot` class will override what the method does in the `Robot` class:

```javascript
class FlyingRobot extends Robot
{
    sayHi()
    {
        console.log(`Hello! My name is ${this.name} and I am a flying robot`)
    }

    // ...
}
```

But if you want to provide a different `constructor`, you have to start the method with `super()` and send the needed parameters to it:

```javascript
class FlyingRobot extends Robot
{
    constructor(name, legs)
    {
        super(name, legs)

        this.canFly = true
    }

    // ...
}
```

`super` corresponds to the base class (`Robot`) and using `super()` is like calling the base `constructor` so that everything we do in the base constructor will be done in the new class, too.

We can also use `super` to call methods from the base class. As an example, we can make the robot say "hi" like it use to and then, in another log, say that it is a flying robot:

```javascript
class FlyingRobot extends Robot
{
    sayHi()
    {
        super.sayHi()

        console.log('I am a flying robot')
    }

    // ...
}
```

But this approach tends to complicate the code.

That's it for classes.

## Combining the classes and the modules [37:45](#)[](#combining-the-classes-and-the-modules)

The idea here is that we are going to separate our code into files and each one of these files will export a different class.

To illustrate that with the robots, create a `/src/Robot.js` file and put the `Robot` class in it, but with an `export default` at the beginning:

```javascript
export default class Robot
{
    constructor(name, legs)
    {
        this.name = name
        this.legs = legs

        console.log(`I am ${this.name}. Thank you creator`)

        this.sayHi()
    }

    sayHi()
    {
        console.log(`Hello! My name is ${this.name}`)
    }
}
```

Now create a `/src/FlyingRobot.js` file and put the `FlyingRobot` class in it, but with an `export default` at the beginning:

```javascript
export default class FlyingRobot extends Robot
{
    constructor(name, legs)
    {
        super(name, legs)

        this.canFly = true
    }

    sayHi()
    {
        console.log(`Hello! My name is ${this.name} and I'm a flying robot`)
    }

    takeOff()
    {
        console.log(`Have a good flight ${this.name}`)
    }

    land()
    {
        console.log(`Welcome back ${this.name}`)
    }
}
```

Before importing them, however, we need to fix an issue.

`FlyingRobot` inherits from `Robot`, but `Robot` isn't available in the file. We need to first import that class to refer to it.

Add the following import:

```javascript
import Robot from './Robot.js'

export default class FlyingRobot extends Robot
{
    // ...
```

In `/src/scripts.js`, we can now import and use these classes:

```javascript
import Robot from './Robot.js'
import FlyingRobot from './FlyingRobot.js'

const wallE = new Robot('Wall-E', 0)
const ultron = new FlyingRobot('Ultron', 2)
const astroBoy = new FlyingRobot('Astro Boy', 2)
```

And our code to create robots becomes suddenly very simple.

At first, all of this might seem a bit complicated, but your code will become much more maintainable and you'll be able to reuse it in different projects simply by copying the classes you need.

## Structuring our project [42:14](#)[](#structuring-our-project)

It's time to use this new knowledge in our project.

Remove the code that we have added above and delete the files related to the robots.

If you uncomment the project code, you'll see a simple scene with a fox on a floor.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1792 1120'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

We are going to keep the existing code and move it into classes piece by piece.

Comment the whole code again.

## Experience class [43:44](#)[](#experience-class)

A good practice is to put the whole experience inside a main class that will then create everything else. This is particularly useful if your WebGL experience is part of a bigger website with HTML content, other pages, etc.

The code related to your experience will be separate from the rest of your code, but still accessible through the class and all the methods and properties you provide within that class.

As for the name of that class, I like to use `Experience` but it can be `MySuperGame`, `WebGLAwesomeStuff`, `Application` or whatever.

### Create and instantiate the class[](#create-and-instantiate-the-class)

In the `/src/` folder, create an `Experience/` folder and, in that `/src/Experience` folder, create an `Experience.js` file.

In that file, export a class as follows:

```javascript
export default class Experience
{
    constructor()
    {
        console.log('Here starts a great experience')
    }
}
```

All classes related to the experience will be in that folder.

In `/src/script.js`, we can import and instantiate that class:

```javascript
import Experience from './Experience/Experience.js'

const experience = new Experience()
```

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 667 68'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Sometimes, it's useful to be able to access the experience right from the console. But the current scope makes that impossible.

What we can do is save the instance in `window`. To do that, we can use the context right inside the `constructor`:

```javascript
export default class Experience
{
    constructor()
    {
        // Global access
        window.experience = this
    }
}
```

Now we can access the experience right from the console by typing `window.experience` or even `experience` because `window` is implicit in JavaScript (what a weirdo).

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 666 176'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Be careful, this is a trick that not everybody will like and if you have multiple experiences, the last one will override the previous ones.

### Canvas[](#canvas)

When instantiating the Experience, we are going to send the canvas as a parameter so that other developers using our class in different situations will be able to choose what `<canvas>` they want to use.

When instantiating in `/src/script.js`, use `querySelector()` to send the canvas parameter:

```javascript
const experience = new Experience(document.querySelector('canvas.webgl'))
```

And, in the class, save it as a property:

```javascript
export default class Experience
{
    constructor(canvas)
    {
        // ...

        // Options
        this.canvas = canvas
    }
}
```

That's the only parameter we will need in this lesson, but you can send any parameter you want to change the experience.

## Useful classes [51:19](#)[](#useful-classes)

There are other classes that are handy to have throughout the project, and that will probably turn out to be useful in your future projects. These classes are not necessarily related to WebGL or Three.js, as you will see. That is the reason why we are going to put them in the `/src/Experience/Utils/` folder which we will create now.

### Sizes[](#sizes)

The first useful class is the one that will handle the sizes of the experience. It'll include the width and the height of the viewport as well as the pixel ratio of the screen.

We are going to update these values when a resize occurs, but we are also going to warn the experience of that resize.

In the `/src/Experience/Utils/` folder, create the `Sizes.js` class:

```javascript
export default class Sizes
{
    constructor()
    {
    }
}
```

And instantiate it in the `Experience` class:

```javascript
import Sizes from './Utils/Sizes.js'

export default class Experience
{
    constructor(canvas)
    {
        // ...

        // Setup
        this.sizes = new Sizes()
    }
}
```

In that `Sizes` class, add the usual `width`, `height` and `pixelRatio` as we did before, but save them as properties:

```javascript
export default class Sizes
{
    constructor()
    {
        // Setup
        this.width = window.innerWidth
        this.height = window.innerHeight
        this.pixelRatio = Math.min(window.devicePixelRatio, 2)
    }
}
```

Then listen to the resize event and update those properties:

```javascript
export default class Sizes
{
    constructor()
    {
        // ...

        // Resize event
        window.addEventListener('resize', () =>
        {
            this.width = window.innerWidth
            this.height = window.innerHeight
            this.pixelRatio = Math.min(window.devicePixelRatio, 2)
        })
    }
}
```

Here, we assume that the experience always fills the viewport. If that's not the case, you'll have to do things differently.

We can now access the `width`, `height` and `pixelRatio` from the `Experience` class:

```javascript
import Sizes from './Utils/Sizes.js'

export default class Experience
{
    constructor(canvas)
    {
        // ...

        this.sizes = new Sizes()

        console.log(this.sizes.width)
        console.log(this.sizes.height)
        console.log(this.sizes.pixelRatio)
    }
}
```

At some point, we will also have to update other values like the camera or the renderer when a resize occurs. We could listen to the `resize` event on `window` like we just did, but instead, we are going to use the `Sizes` class to warn the other classes about that change.

### Event Emitter[](#event-emitter)

What we are going to do now is make a little change to our `Sizes` class so that it can trigger events. Later, we are going to listen to those events.

To do that, we are going to make that class inherit from an `EventEmitter` class.

Add the `EventEmitter` class from below to the `/src/Experience/Utils/` folder:

```javascript
export default class EventEmitter
{
    constructor()
    {
        this.callbacks = {}
        this.callbacks.base = {}
    }

    on(_names, callback)
    {
        // Errors
        if(typeof _names === 'undefined' || _names === '')
        {
            console.warn('wrong names')
            return false
        }

        if(typeof callback === 'undefined')
        {
            console.warn('wrong callback')
            return false
        }

        // Resolve names
        const names = this.resolveNames(_names)

        // Each name
        names.forEach((_name) =>
        {
            // Resolve name
            const name = this.resolveName(_name)

            // Create namespace if not exist
            if(!(this.callbacks[ name.namespace ] instanceof Object))
                this.callbacks[ name.namespace ] = {}

            // Create callback if not exist
            if(!(this.callbacks[ name.namespace ][ name.value ] instanceof Array))
                this.callbacks[ name.namespace ][ name.value ] = []

            // Add callback
            this.callbacks[ name.namespace ][ name.value ].push(callback)
        })

        return this
    }

    off(_names)
    {
        // Errors
        if(typeof _names === 'undefined' || _names === '')
        {
            console.warn('wrong name')
            return false
        }

        // Resolve names
        const names = this.resolveNames(_names)

        // Each name
        names.forEach((_name) =>
        {
            // Resolve name
            const name = this.resolveName(_name)

            // Remove namespace
            if(name.namespace !== 'base' && name.value === '')
            {
                delete this.callbacks[ name.namespace ]
            }

            // Remove specific callback in namespace
            else
            {
                // Default
                if(name.namespace === 'base')
                {
                    // Try to remove from each namespace
                    for(const namespace in this.callbacks)
                    {
                        if(this.callbacks[ namespace ] instanceof Object && this.callbacks[ namespace ][ name.value ] instanceof Array)
                        {
                            delete this.callbacks[ namespace ][ name.value ]

                            // Remove namespace if empty
                            if(Object.keys(this.callbacks[ namespace ]).length === 0)
                                delete this.callbacks[ namespace ]
                        }
                    }
                }

                // Specified namespace
                else if(this.callbacks[ name.namespace ] instanceof Object && this.callbacks[ name.namespace ][ name.value ] instanceof Array)
                {
                    delete this.callbacks[ name.namespace ][ name.value ]

                    // Remove namespace if empty
                    if(Object.keys(this.callbacks[ name.namespace ]).length === 0)
                        delete this.callbacks[ name.namespace ]
                }
            }
        })

        return this
    }

    trigger(_name, _args)
    {
        // Errors
        if(typeof _name === 'undefined' || _name === '')
        {
            console.warn('wrong name')
            return false
        }

        let finalResult = null
        let result = null

        // Default args
        const args = !(_args instanceof Array) ? [] : _args

        // Resolve names (should on have one event)
        let name = this.resolveNames(_name)

        // Resolve name
        name = this.resolveName(name[ 0 ])

        // Default namespace
        if(name.namespace === 'base')
        {
            // Try to find callback in each namespace
            for(const namespace in this.callbacks)
            {
                if(this.callbacks[ namespace ] instanceof Object && this.callbacks[ namespace ][ name.value ] instanceof Array)
                {
                    this.callbacks[ namespace ][ name.value ].forEach(function(callback)
                    {
                        result = callback.apply(this, args)

                        if(typeof finalResult === 'undefined')
                        {
                            finalResult = result
                        }
                    })
                }
            }
        }

        // Specified namespace
        else if(this.callbacks[ name.namespace ] instanceof Object)
        {
            if(name.value === '')
            {
                console.warn('wrong name')
                return this
            }

            this.callbacks[ name.namespace ][ name.value ].forEach(function(callback)
            {
                result = callback.apply(this, args)

                if(typeof finalResult === 'undefined')
                    finalResult = result
            })
        }

        return finalResult
    }

    resolveNames(_names)
    {
        let names = _names
        names = names.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9 ,/.]/g, '')
        names = names.replace(/[,/]+/g, ' ')
        names = names.split(' ')

        return names
    }

    resolveName(name)
    {
        const newName = {}
        const parts = name.split('.')

        newName.original  = name
        newName.value     = parts[ 0 ]
        newName.namespace = 'base' // Base namespace

        // Specified namespace
        if(parts.length > 1 && parts[ 1 ] !== '')
        {
            newName.namespace = parts[ 1 ]
        }

        return newName
    }
}
```

In case you are wondering, I wrote this class years ago and I've been using it on dozens of projects. We are not going to explain the code, but we are going to explain the methods we need and will use.

Make the `Sizes` class inherit from that `EventEmitter` class. Don't forget to import it and to use the `super()` function at the start of the `constructor`:

```javascript
import EventEmitter from './EventEmitter.js'

export default class Sizes extends EventEmitter
{
    constructor()
    {
        super()
        
        // ...
    }
}
```

Nothing seems to have changed, but now, our `Sizes` class has access to the `EventEmitter` methods.

There are two methods that we need.

The `on(...)` method will listen to events just like `addEventListener()` and the `trigger(...)` method will trigger those events. We are going to trigger events from inside the class and listen to those events from outside the class.

In the `resize` event callback of the `Sizes` class, trigger an event named `resize`:

```javascript
export default class Sizes extends EventEmitter
{
    constructor()
    {
        // ...

        window.addEventListener('resize', () =>
        {
            // ...

            this.trigger('resize')
        })
    }
}
```

You can choose any name for the event, but `resize` seems appropriate.

In the `Experience` class, listen to the `resize` event on the instance of the `Size` class with the same event name:

```javascript
import Sizes from './Utils/Sizes.js'

export default class Experience
{
    constructor(canvas)
    {
        // Global access
        window.experience = this

        // Options
        this.canvas = canvas

        // Setup
        this.sizes = new Sizes()

        // Resize event
        this.sizes.on('resize', () =>
        {
            console.log('A resize occurred')
        })
    }
}
```

Resize the viewport and you should see `A resize occurred` in the console.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 373 32'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Later, we will have more instructions on what to do when a resize occurs, which is why we should put it in a separate method. Create a `resize()` method and call that method when the `resize` event occurs:

```javascript
import Sizes from './Utils/Sizes.js'

export default class Experience
{
    constructor(canvas)
    {
        // ...

        this.sizes.on('resize', () =>
        {
            this.resize()
        })
    }

    resize()
    {

    }
}
```

We can't send the `resize` method directly as the parameter (`this.sizes.on('resize', this.resize)`) because the context (`this`) will be the `Sizes` instance and not the `Experience` instance. This is a classic context issue that we can fix with binding, but we are not going to cover that here. Instead, we will just call `resize` from inside an arrow function.

That's it for our `Sizes` class.

### Time[](#time)

Another very useful class is the one handling the time. This class will work a bit like the [Clock](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/core/Clock) class of Three.js.

It will save:

*   the current time.
*   the elapsed time.
*   the delta time between the current frame and the previous frame.

The class will also trigger an event on each frame so that we can listen to that event and update the whole experience.

In the `/src/Experience/Utils/` folder, create the `Time.js` class and inherit from the `EventEmitter` class:

```javascript
import EventEmitter from './EventEmitter.js'

export default class Time extends EventEmitter
{
    constructor()
    {
        super()
    }
}
```

Instantiate that class in the `Experience` class as we did for the `Sizes` class:

```javascript
import Sizes from './Utils/Sizes.js'
import Time from './Utils/Time.js'

export default class Experience
{
    constructor(canvas)
    {
        // ...

        this.sizes = new Sizes()
        this.time = new Time()

        // ...
    }
}
```

Create the following properties in the `Time.js` class:

```javascript
import EventEmitter from './EventEmitter.js'

export default class Time extends EventEmitter
{
    constructor()
    {
        super()

        // Setup
        this.start = Date.now()
        this.current = this.start
        this.elapsed = 0
        this.delta = 16
    }
}
```

*   `start` will contain the timestamp when the experience starts and will stay the same.
*   `current` will contain the current timestamp and will change on each frame.
*   `elapsed` will contain how much time was spent since the start of the experience.
*   `delta` will contain how much time was spent since the previous frame. We set it as 16 by default which is close to how many milliseconds there is between two frames at 60fps.

Then we can create a `tick()` method and do the same loop as we did at the beginning of the course with `window.requestAnimationFrame(...)`:

```javascript
// ...

export default class Time extends EventEmitter
{
    constructor()
    {
        // ...

        window.requestAnimationFrame(() =>
        {
            this.tick()
        })
    }

    tick()
    {
        console.log('tick')

        window.requestAnimationFrame(() =>
        {
            this.tick()
        })
    }
}
```

You should see a bunch of `tick` logs in the console.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 719 109'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

We could have called the `tick` method immediately in the `constructor` without the `window.requestAnimationFrame`, but this would result in a delta equal to `0` on the first frame.

We can now update the `current` time, calculate the `delta` time and update the `elapsed` time:

```javascript
// ...

export default class Time extends EventEmitter
{
    // ...

    tick()
    {
        const currentTime = Date.now()
        this.delta = currentTime - this.current
        this.current = currentTime
        this.elapsed = this.current - this.start

        // ...
    }
}
```

You can test those values to make sure that they are right. They will be in milliseconds, but you can do some math to change them to seconds if you prefer.

Finally, we can trigger a `tick` event:

```javascript
// ...

export default class Time extends EventEmitter
{
    // ...

    tick()
    {
        const currentTime = Date.now()
        this.delta = currentTime - this.current
        this.current = currentTime
        this.elapsed = this.current - this.start

        this.trigger('tick')

        // ...
    }
}
```

And listen to that event in the `Experience` class to call an `update()` method:

```javascript
// ...

export default class Experience
{
    constructor(canvas)
    {
        // ...

        // Time tick event
        this.time.on('tick', () =>
        {
            this.update()
        })
    }

    // ...

    update()
    {
        
    }
}
```

We now have a `resize()` method and an `update()` method in the `Experience`. Those methods are called automatically and they are going to update the rest of the experience when needed.

The `EventEmitter` can be used for any of your classes that need to trigger events. For example, it can be used to signal that an animation of the model has finished, that an object has been clicked on, that the player is going out of the level, etc.

Later, we are going to use it to tell the experience that all the resources are loaded.

## Scene [01:19:44](#)[](#scene)

Now that we have our main class and some useful classes, we can start working with Three.js.

In the `Experience` class, add a scene property with the [Scene](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=scene#api/en/scenes/Scene) class. Don't forget to import `three` like we use to:

```javascript
import * as THREE from 'three'

// ...

export default class Experience
{
    constructor(canvas)
    {
        // ...

        this.sizes = new Sizes()
        this.time = new Time()
        this.scene = new THREE.Scene()

        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```

## Camera (and Singleton) [01:20:46](#)[](#camera-and-singleton)

For the camera, we are going to create a separate class.

In the `/src/Experience/` folder, create a `Camera` class:

```javascript
export default class Camera
{
    constructor()
    {
        
    }
}
```

And instantiate it in the `Experience` class:

```javascript
// ...
import Camera from './Camera.js'

export default class Experience
{
    constructor(canvas)
    {
        // ...

        this.sizes = new Sizes()
        this.time = new Time()
        this.scene = new THREE.Scene()
        this.camera = new Camera()

        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```

But now, we have an issue. In the `Camera` class, we are going to instantiate the [PerspectiveCamera](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=persp#api/en/cameras/PerspectiveCamera) and the [OrbitControls](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=orbit#examples/en/controls/OrbitControls) classes. But these additional classes need information like the `width` and `height`, as well as the `<canvas>` for [OrbitControls](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=orbit#examples/en/controls/OrbitControls). We also need to add this class to the [Scene](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=scene#api/en/scenes/Scene).

In other words, we need access to properties that we have in the `Experience` class.

There are three ways of accessing the experience from the camera:

*   From a global variable
*   By sending a parameter
*   By using a singleton

We are going to explore all three techniques for the sake of learning them, but only use one.

### Accessing the experience[](#accessing-the-experience)

**From a global variable**

Earlier, we added the experience to `window` with:

```javascript
window.experience = this
```

This makes it accessible anywhere in the code as shown here in the `Camera` class:

```javascript
export default class Camera
{
    constructor()
    {
        this.experience = window.experience

        console.log(this.experience)
    }
}
```

While this works, it assumes that we do have the `experience` property available in `window` and that there is no other part of the code that will mess up this property.

Adding global properties to `window` isn't recommended which is why we won't use that technique.

**From a parameter**

Another solution would be to send the experience as a parameter to each class that needs it.

In the `Experience` class, we would type:

```javascript
// ...

export default class Experience
{
    constructor(canvas)
    {
        // ...

        this.camera = new Camera(this)

        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```

And in the `Camera` class, we would type this:

```javascript
export default class Camera
{
    constructor(experience)
    {
        this.experience = experience
        
        console.log(this.experience)
    }
}
```

This solution is a good solution. The main issue is that we need to do this for every class that needs access to the experience as well as to their parents if we have a deeper structure.

We could totally go for this solution, but for the sake of learning, we will use the next one.

**Through a singleton**

To put it in a nutshell, a singleton is a class that will instantiate just like usual when it's the first time. But, for all the following times, it will return that first instance.

We can do a bunch of `new Experience()` instantiations, but only the first one will be the real instance. All the other instantiations will also return that first instance.

To convert our `Experience` class to a singleton, add the following code at the very start of the `constructor`:

```javascript
// ...

let instance = null

export default class Experience
{
    constructor(canvas)
    {
        // Singleton
        if(instance)
        {
            return instance
        }
        instance = this
        
        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```

We create an `instance` variable and set it to `null` outside of the class.

In the `constructor`, we test if there is something in that variable. If that's the case, then we return what's inside. When we do a `return`, the function stops there and the rest won't be executed. Otherwise, we save the instance (`this`) in that variable and go on with the rest of the function.

Now, we can import the `Experience` wherever we need it in our code and then instantiate it to retrieve the first instance.

In the `Camera` class:

```javascript
import Experience from './Experience.js'

export default class Camera
{
    constructor()
    {
        this.experience = new Experience()

        console.log(this.experience)
    }
}
```

This solution sounds a bit more clean, but also a bit more complicated. Don't hesitate to use one of the previous solutions if you don't feel comfortable with singletons.

Now that we have access to the experience, we also have access to its properties. We are going to need the `sizes`, the `scene` and the `canvas`. We can save those as properties to the `Camera` class:

```javascript
import Experience from './Experience.js'

export default class Camera
{
    constructor()
    {
        this.experience = new Experience()
        this.sizes = this.experience.sizes
        this.scene = this.experience.scene
        this.canvas = this.experience.canvas
    }
}
```

### Instance[](#instance)

Create the [PerspectiveCamera](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=orbit#api/en/cameras/PerspectiveCamera) and save it as an `instance` property. Don't forget to import `three`:

```javascript
import * as THREE from 'three'
import Experience from './Experience.js'

export default class Camera
{
    constructor()
    {
        this.experience = new Experience()
        this.sizes = this.experience.sizes
        this.scene = this.experience.scene
        this.canvas = this.experience.canvas

        this.setInstance()
    }

    setInstance()
    {
        this.instance = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(35, this.sizes.width / this.sizes.height, 0.1, 100)
        this.instance.position.set(6, 4, 8)
        this.scene.add(this.instance)
    }
}
```

### OrbitControls[](#orbitcontrols)

Do the same for the [OrbitControls](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=orbit#examples/en/controls/OrbitControls):

```javascript
// ...
import { OrbitControls } from 'three/examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls.js'

export default class Camera
{
    constructor()
    {
        // ...

        this.setControls()
    }

    // ...

    setControls()
    {
        this.controls = new OrbitControls(this.instance, this.canvas)
        this.controls.enableDamping = true
    }
}
```

### Resize[](#resize)

We can't test it yet, but if we were to resize the viewport, the camera would not be updated.

We could listen to the `resize` event on the `Sizes` class. But it's better to call it from the parent (`Experience`) to the children (`Camera`). It's not relevant here, but once we have a lot of classes with many resizes that propagate through the instances, it's useful to have control over the order of those resizes.

In the `Camera` class, add the `resize()` method:

```javascript
// ...

export default class Camera
{
    // ...

    resize()
    {
        this.instance.aspect = this.sizes.width / this.sizes.height
        this.instance.updateProjectionMatrix()
    }
}
```

In the `resize()` method of the `Experience` class, call that method:

```javascript
// ...

export default class Experience
{
    // ...

    resize()
    {
        this.camera.resize()
    }

    // ...
}
```

We still can't really test this because there is nothing in the scene yet that we can see. But you can try to resize the viewport to check for potential errors even if the page stays white.

### Update[](#update)

Just as we did with the resize, we also need to update this class on each frame. This is due to the [OrbitControls](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=orbit#examples/en/controls/OrbitControls) and its damping feature.

In the `Camera` class, create the `update` method:

```javascript
// ...

export default class Camera
{
    // ...

    update()
    {
        this.controls.update()
    }
}
```

And call it in the `Experience` class:

```javascript
// ...

export default class Experience
{
    // ...

    update()
    {
        this.camera.update()
    }
}
```

And you should now see a pattern for our structure in which everything starts from the main class and propagates to the children.

## Renderer [01:39:05](#)[](#renderer)

Just like the way we created the `Camera` class, let's create a `Renderer` class.

Create a `/src/Experience/Renderer.js` file.

In this class, retrieve the `Experience` and the following properties:

```javascript
import Experience from './Experience.js'

export default class Renderer
{
    constructor()
    {
        this.experience = new Experience()
        this.canvas = this.experience.canvas
        this.sizes = this.experience.sizes
        this.scene = this.experience.scene
        this.camera = this.experience.camera
    }
}
```

Import and instantiate this class in the `Experience`:

```javascript
// ...

import Renderer from './Renderer.js'

// ...

export default class Experience
{
    constructor(canvas)
    {
        // ...

        this.renderer = new Renderer()

        // ...
    }
}
```

We can now instantiate the [WebGLRenderer](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=webglrend#api/en/renderers/WebGLRenderer) and use `this.sizes` instead of `sizes` (don't forget to import `three`):

```javascript
import * as THREE from 'three'
import Experience from './Experience.js'

export default class Renderer
{
    constructor()
    {
        // ...

        this.setInstance()
    }

    setInstance()
    {
        this.instance = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({
            canvas: this.canvas,
            antialias: true
        })
        this.instance.toneMapping = THREE.CineonToneMapping
        this.instance.toneMappingExposure = 1.75
        this.instance.shadowMap.enabled = true
        this.instance.shadowMap.type = THREE.PCFSoftShadowMap
        this.instance.setSize(this.sizes.width, this.sizes.height)
        this.instance.setPixelRatio(Math.min(window.devicePixelRatio, 2))
    }
}
```

And since we already calculated the `pixelRatio` in `Sizes`, we can use it directly without `Math.min()`:

```javascript
export default class Renderer
{
    setInstance()
    {
        // ...
        this.instance.setPixelRatio(this.sizes.pixelRatio)
    }
}
```

Add the `resize()` method:

```javascript
// ...

export default class Renderer
{
    // ...

    resize()
    {
        this.instance.setSize(this.sizes.width, this.sizes.height)
        this.instance.setPixelRatio(this.sizes.pixelRatio)
    }
}
```

And call it from the `resize()` method in the `Experience` class:

```javascript
// ...

export default class Experience
{
    // ...

    resize()
    {
        this.camera.resize()
        this.renderer.resize()
    }

    // ...
}
```

Add the `update()` method to do the render by using the `scene` and the `camera`. Be careful, the `camera` property is an instance of our `Camera` class, not the Three.js camera. We can access the Three.js camera by doing `this.camera.instance`:

```javascript
// ...

export default class Renderer
{
    // ...

    update()
    {
        this.instance.render(this.scene, this.camera.instance)
    }
}
```

And call it in the `Experience` class:

```javascript
// ...

export default class Experience
{
    // ...

    update()
    {
        this.camera.update()
        this.renderer.update()
    }
}
```

Still nothing on the screen, but we are getting close. We are actually doing the renders, but our scene is empty.

## World [01:47:06](#)[](#world)

It's time to add some visible stuff to our scene. To prevent having too many classes in the `/src/Experience` folder, we are going to separate everything that composes our World in a separate class and folder named `World`.

Create a `World` folder in `/src/Experience/` and create a `World` class inside it. Start by retrieving the `Experience` and the `scene` in the newly created class:

```javascript
import Experience from '../Experience.js'

export default class World
{
    constructor()
    {
        this.experience = new Experience()
        this.scene = this.experience.scene
    }
}
```

Instantiate it in the `Experience`:

```javascript
import World from './World/World.js'

// ...

export default class Experience
{
    constructor(canvas)
    {
        // ...

        this.world = new World()

        // ...
    }
}
```

Let's add a test [Mesh](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=mesh#api/en/objects/Mesh) to our `World`. Don't forget to import `three`:

```javascript
import * as THREE from 'three'

// ...

export default class World
{
    constructor()
    {
        // ...

        // Test mesh
        const testMesh = new THREE.Mesh(
            new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1),
            new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ wireframe: true })
        )
        this.scene.add(testMesh)
    }
}
```

Congratulations, you can finally see something.

## Sunlight [01:51:33](#)[](#sunlight)

If you remember what our scene looked like, we had a fox on a floor with lights and shadows. Before going any further, we need to add a light to the scene we are building.

This is a part where the structure can vary a lot according to your project's characteristics and your preferences. For this experience, we are going to create an `Environment` class that will contain the light. Later on, we are going to add an environment map to it.

First, let's change our `testMesh` material to a [MeshStandardMaterial](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=meshstan#api/en/materials/MeshStandardMaterial) so that we will be able to see the light:

```javascript
// ...

export default class World
{
    constructor()
    {
        // ...

        // Test mesh
        const testMesh = new THREE.Mesh(
            new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1),
            new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial()
        )
        this.scene.add(testMesh)
    }
}
```

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1792 1120'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Now create the `Environment` class in the `/src/Experience/World/` folder:

```javascript
import Experience from '../Experience.js'

export default class Environment
{
    constructor()
    {
        this.experience = new Experience()
        this.scene = this.experience.scene
    }
}
```

And then, instantiate it in the `World` class after the `testMesh`:

```javascript
// ...
import Environment from './Environment.js'

export default class World
{
    constructor()
    {
        // ...

        // Setup
        this.environment = new Environment()
    }
}
```

Now, we can add the light to that environment.

Because our light will imitate the sun, we can name the property `sunLight`. Don't forget to import `three`:

```javascript
import * as THREE from 'three'
import Experience from '../Experience.js'

export default class Environment
{
    constructor()
    {
        this.experience = new Experience()
        this.scene = this.experience.scene

        // Setup
        this.setSunLight()
    }

    setSunLight()
    {
        this.sunLight = new THREE.DirectionalLight('#ffffff', 4)
        this.sunLight.castShadow = true
        this.sunLight.shadow.camera.far = 15
        this.sunLight.shadow.mapSize.set(1024, 1024)
        this.sunLight.shadow.normalBias = 0.05
        this.sunLight.position.set(3, 3, - 2.25)
        this.scene.add(this.sunLight)
    }
}
```

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1792 1120'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

In the base project, we also had an environment map. We could instantiate a [CubeTextureLoader](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=cubete#api/en/loaders/CubeTextureLoader) in the `Environment` class, but that would mean that each class would handle resource loading on its own. We would end up with a mess in which we wouldn't know if assets were ready and they would pop on screen when they were loaded.

## Resources [01:55:52](#)[](#resources)

To make things cleaner, we are going to centralize asset loading in a dedicated class. This class will instantiate all of the loaders we need. We then send an array of assets to load and once all those assets are loaded, we make that class trigger an event.

In the `/src/Experience/Utils/` folder, create a `Resources` class. We already know that this class is going to trigger an event which is why we can extend the `EventEmitter` class:

```javascript
import EventEmitter from './EventEmitter.js'

export default class Resources extends EventEmitter
{
    constructor()
    {
        super()
    }
}
```

Instantiate it in the `Experience` class right after instantiating the scene:

```javascript
// ...

import Resources from './Utils/Resources.js'

// ...

export default class Experience
{
    constructor(canvas)
    {
        // ...

        this.scene = new THREE.Scene()
        this.resources = new Resources()

        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```

For the list of assets to load, we are going to use an array. Each resource in the array will be defined by an object composed of the following properties:

*   `name`: which will be used to retrieve the loaded resources.
*   `type`: in order to know what loader to use.
*   `path`: the path(s) of the file(s) to load.

For a bigger project, this array might get a bit fat, which is why it's preferable to have it in a separate file.

In the `/src/Experience/` folder, create a `sources.js` file that exports the following array:

```javascript
export default [
    {
        name: 'environmentMapTexture',
        type: 'cubeTexture',
        path:
        [
            'textures/environmentMap/px.jpg',
            'textures/environmentMap/nx.jpg',
            'textures/environmentMap/py.jpg',
            'textures/environmentMap/ny.jpg',
            'textures/environmentMap/pz.jpg',
            'textures/environmentMap/nz.jpg'
        ]
    }
]
```

We are going to add more sources to this array later.

Now, in the `Experience` class, import that array and send it as a parameter to the `Resources` class:

```javascript
// ...

import sources from './sources.js'

// ...

export default class Experience
{
    constructor(canvas)
    {
        // ...

        this.resources = new Resources(sources)

        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```

And then save it as a property in the `Resources` class:

```javascript
import EventEmitter from './EventEmitter.js'

export default class Resources extends EventEmitter
{
    constructor(sources)
    {
        super()

        // Options
        this.sources = sources

        console.log(this.sources)
    }
}
```

You should see your sources in the console.

In the `Resources` class, create these three properties:

*   `items` which contains the loaded resource; we will populate this property as the sources are being loaded.
*   `toLoad` which contains the number of sources to load (`this.sources.length`).
*   `loaded` which contains the number of sources loaded (starts at `0`).

```javascript
import EventEmitter from './EventEmitter.js'

export default class Resources extends EventEmitter
{
    constructor(sources)
    {
        // ...

        // Setup
        this.items = {}
        this.toLoad = this.sources.length
        this.loaded = 0
    }
}
```

We are now going to create the different loaders. In this project, we will need the [GLTFLoader](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=GLTFLoader#examples/en/loaders/GLTFLoader), the [TextureLoader](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=TextureLoader#api/en/loaders/TextureLoader) and the [CubeTextureLoader](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=TextureLoader#api/en/loaders/CubeTextureLoader). We are going to create them all at once, but you would normally have progressively added them as you worked. Don't forget to import `three` and the `GLTFLoader`:

```javascript
import * as THREE from 'three'
import { GLTFLoader } from 'three/examples/jsm/loaders/GLTFLoader.js'

// ...

export default class Resources extends EventEmitter
{
    constructor(sources)
    {
        // ...

        this.setLoaders()
    }

    setLoaders()
    {
        this.loaders = {}
        this.loaders.gltfLoader = new GLTFLoader()
        this.loaders.textureLoader = new THREE.TextureLoader()
        this.loaders.cubeTextureLoader = new THREE.CubeTextureLoader()
    }
}
```

We are not going to use a Draco compressed model, but if you want to load one, you'll need to add the [DracoLoader](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/loaders/DRACOLoader) here as well.

We are now going to create a `startLoading()` method. In that method, we are going to loop through the `sources` array and load them by using the corresponding loader:

```javascript
// ...

export default class Resources extends EventEmitter
{
    constructor(sources)
    {
        // ...

        this.startLoading()
    }

    // ...

    startLoading()
    {
        // Load each source
        for(const source of this.sources)
        {
            if(source.type === 'gltfModel')
            {
                this.loaders.gltfLoader.load(
                    source.path,
                    (file) =>
                    {
                        console.log(source, file)
                    }
                )
            }
            else if(source.type === 'texture')
            {
                this.loaders.textureLoader.load(
                    source.path,
                    (file) =>
                    {
                        console.log(source, file)
                    }
                )
            }
            else if(source.type === 'cubeTexture')
            {
                this.loaders.cubeTextureLoader.load(
                    source.path,
                    (file) =>
                    {
                        console.log(source, file)
                    }
                )
            }
        }
    }
}
```

You should see the source and the loaded resource being logged in the console as it is loaded.

On each load, we are going to call a `sourceLoaded` method that will save the loaded resources in the `items` property, update the `loaded` property and test if the loading is done. If all the sources are loaded, we trigger a `ready` event:

```javascript
// ...

export default class Resources extends EventEmitter
{
    // ...

    startLoading()
    {
        // Load each source
        for(const source of this.sources)
        {
            if(source.type === 'gltfModel')
            {
                this.loaders.gltfLoader.load(
                    source.path,
                    (file) =>
                    {
                        this.sourceLoaded(source, file)
                    }
                )
            }
            else if(source.type === 'texture')
            {
                this.loaders.textureLoader.load(
                    source.path,
                    (file) =>
                    {
                        this.sourceLoaded(source, file)
                    }
                )
            }
            else if(source.type === 'cubeTexture')
            {
                this.loaders.cubeTextureLoader.load(
                    source.path,
                    (file) =>
                    {
                        this.sourceLoaded(source, file)
                    }
                )
            }
        }
    }

    sourceLoaded(source, file)
    {
        this.items[source.name] = file

        this.loaded++

        if(this.loaded === this.toLoad)
        {
            this.trigger('ready')
        }
    }
}
```

Nothing should happen, but now we can listen to the `ready` event on the `Resources` instance.

In the `World` class, retrieve the `Resources` instance and listen to the `ready` event before instantiating the `Environment` class:

```javascript
// ...

export default class World
{
    constructor()
    {
        // ...

        this.resources = this.experience.resources

        // Wait for resources
        this.resources.on('ready', () =>
        {
            // Setup
            this.environment = new Environment()
        })

        // ...
    }
}
```

Where and how you listen to the `ready` event is up to you. In this project, we are going to need the resources for every component of the world. But in other projects, you can start showing things to the user while the rest of the experience is loading and, once loaded, you can add the rest of them to the scene.

Check [bruno-simon.com](https://bruno-simon.com/) as an example. The graphic for the loader shows up almost immediately even if it's 3D. Then, once the rest is loaded, we can click on the button and discover the experience.

## Environment map [02:18:08](#)[](#environment-map)

We can now retrieve the `Resources` instance in the environment and use the `environmentMapTexture` item to create the environment map:

```javascript
// ...

export default class Environment
{
    constructor()
    {
        // ...
        this.resources = this.experience.resources
        
        // Setup
        this.setSunLight()
        this.setEnvironmentMap()
    }

    // ...

    setEnvironmentMap()
    {
        this.environmentMap = {}
        this.environmentMap.intensity = 0.4
        this.environmentMap.texture = this.resources.items.environmentMapTexture
        this.environmentMap.texture.colorSpace = THREE.SRGBColorSpace
        
        this.scene.environment = this.environmentMap.texture
    }
}
```

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1792 1120'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Unfortunately, this won't work because the environment map is added after the cube and we need to inform the cube material that it needs to be updated.

Add an `updateMaterials` method to the `environmentMap` property which will traverse the scene and update materials if needed and call them right after:

```javascript
// ...

export default class Environment
{
    // ...

    setEnvironmentMap()
    {
        // ...

        this.environmentMap.updateMaterials = () =>
        {
            this.scene.traverse((child) =>
            {
                if(child instanceof THREE.Mesh && child.material instanceof THREE.MeshStandardMaterial)
                {
                    child.material.envMap = this.environmentMap.texture
                    child.material.envMapIntensity = this.environmentMap.intensity
                    child.material.needsUpdate = true
                }
            })
        }
        this.environmentMap.updateMaterials()
    }
}
```

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1792 1120'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

You should see the environment map affecting the dark faces of the cube which now look brighter.

Putting the scene traverse in a separate function will become handy later.

## Floor [02:24:40](#)[](#floor)

The floor will be a bit easier to add now that we have our `Resources` class.

First, load the two textures located in `/textures/dirt/color.jpg` and `/textures/dirt/normal.jpg` by adding them to the `sources.js` file:

```javascript
export default [

    /* ... */,
    {
        name: 'grassColorTexture',
        type: 'texture',
        path: 'textures/dirt/color.jpg'
    },
    {
        name: 'grassNormalTexture',
        type: 'texture',
        path: 'textures/dirt/normal.jpg'
    }
]
```

(Do not forget the `,` at the end of the previous source).

Create a `Floor` class in the `/src/Experience/World/` folder:

```javascript
import Experience from '../Experience.js'

export default class Floor
{
    constructor()
    {
        this.experience = new Experience()
        this.scene = this.experience.scene
        this.resources = this.experience.resources
    }
}
```

And then instantiate it in the `World` class. Make sure to do this before the `Environment` since the environment updates each child of the scene, and we want the floor to be in that scene when this happens:

```javascript
// ...

import Floor from './Floor.js'

export default class World
{
    constructor()
    {
        // ...

        this.resources.on('ready', () =>
        {
            // Setup
            this.floor = new Floor()
            this.environment = new Environment()
        })

        // ...
    }
}
```

In this example, we are going to separate each part of the floor into a separate method:

*   `setGeometry`
*   `setTextures`
*   `setMaterial`
*   `setMesh`

```javascript
import Experience from '../Experience.js'

export default class Floor
{
    constructor()
    {
        this.experience = new Experience()
        this.scene = this.experience.scene
        this.resources = this.experience.resources

        // Setup
        this.setGeometry()
        this.setTextures()
        this.setMaterial()
        this.setMesh()
    }
}
```

For the geometry, we create a [CircleGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=CircleGeometry#api/en/geometries/CircleGeometry). Don't forget to import `three`:

```javascript
import * as THREE from 'three'

// ...

export default class Floor
{
    // ...

    setGeometry()
    {
        this.geometry = new THREE.CircleGeometry(5, 64)
    }
}
```

Before setting the material, we need to do some work on the textures. We need to make them repeat and make sure that the `colorSpace` of the color texture is `SRGBColorSpace`:

```javascript
// ...

export default class Floor
{
    // ...

    setTextures()
    {
        this.textures = {}

        this.textures.color = this.resources.items.grassColorTexture
        this.textures.color.colorSpace = THREE.SRGBColorSpace
        this.textures.color.repeat.set(1.5, 1.5)
        this.textures.color.wrapS = THREE.RepeatWrapping
        this.textures.color.wrapT = THREE.RepeatWrapping

        this.textures.normal = this.resources.items.grassNormalTexture
        this.textures.normal.repeat.set(1.5, 1.5)
        this.textures.normal.wrapS = THREE.RepeatWrapping
        this.textures.normal.wrapT = THREE.RepeatWrapping
    }
}
```

Now we can add the material:

```javascript
// ...

export default class Floor
{
    // ...

    setMaterial()
    {
        this.material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
            map: this.textures.color,
            normalMap: this.textures.normal
        })
    }
}
```

And finally the mesh without forgetting to make sure it receives a shadow:

```javascript
// ...

export default class Floor
{
    // ...

    setMesh()
    {
        this.mesh = new THREE.Mesh(this.geometry, this.material)
        this.mesh.rotation.x = - Math.PI * 0.5
        this.mesh.receiveShadow = true
        this.scene.add(this.mesh)
    }
}
```

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1792 1120'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

We now have a nice-looking floor and we can get rid of the box.

Don't mind the missing shadow, we will fix that later.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1792 1120'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

No, this is not a pancake.

## Fox [02:33:39](#)[](#fox)

The process for the fox is very similar. We are going to load the model and add it to the scene.

The difference will be with the animation.

Load the model located in `/models/Fox/glTF/Fox.gltf` by adding it to `sources.js`:

```javascript
export default [
    // ...
    {
        name: 'foxModel',
        type: 'gltfModel',
        path: 'models/Fox/glTF/Fox.gltf'
    }
]
```

Create a `Fox` class in the `/src/Experience/World/` folder:

```javascript
import Experience from '../Experience.js'

export default class Fox
{
    constructor()
    {
        this.experience = new Experience()
        this.scene = this.experience.scene
        this.resources = this.experience.resources
    }
}
```

And instantiate it in the `World` class, but make sure to do it before the `Environment` because the environment will update each child of the scene and we want the fox to be in that scene when it does:

```javascript
// ...

import Fox from './Fox.js'

export default class World
{
    constructor()
    {
        // ...

        this.resources.on('ready', () =>
        {
            // Setup
            this.floor = new Floor()
            this.fox = new Fox()
            this.environment = new Environment()
        })
    }
}
```

In the `Fox` class we can fetch the resource from the `Resources`:

```javascript
// ...

export default class Fox
{
    constructor()
    {
        // ...

        // Setup
        this.resource = this.resources.items.foxModel
    }
}
```

The actual model is accessible as an item called `scene` within our resource called `foxModel`. But, since we are going to need more items within that resource, we save all of it as a property.

In a separate method, save the actual model, scale it, add it to your scene and make sure that it casts shadows. Don't forget to import `three`:

```javascript
import * as THREE from 'three'
// ...

export default class Fox
{
    constructor()
    {
        // ...

        this.setModel()
    }

    setModel()
    {
        this.model = this.resource.scene
        this.model.scale.set(0.02, 0.02, 0.02)
        this.scene.add(this.model)

        this.model.traverse((child) =>
        {
            if(child instanceof THREE.Mesh)
            {
                child.castShadow = true
            }
        })
    }
}
```

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1792 1120'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Here is our fox, but we still need to make the animation work.

Create an [AnimationMixer](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=mixer#api/en/animation/AnimationMixer) in the `Fox` class and add the first animation from `this.resource.animations`:

```javascript
// ...

export default class Fox
{
    constructor()
    {
        // ...

        this.setAnimation()
    }

    // ...

    setAnimation()
    {
        this.animation = {}
        this.animation.mixer = new THREE.AnimationMixer(this.model)
        this.animation.action = this.animation.mixer.clipAction(this.resource.animations[0])
        this.animation.action.play()
    }
}
```

This is a good start, but if you remember from one of the previous lessons, we need to update that mixer on each frame.

To do that, we are going to update the `World` and the `World` is going to update the `Fox`.

In the `Experience` class, update the `World`. Make sure to do it right before doing a render:

```javascript
//...

export default class Experience
{
    // ...

    update()
    {
        this.camera.update()
        this.world.update()
        this.renderer.update()
    }
}
```

In the `World`, update the `Fox`, but first, make sure that it exists since the model might not have loaded yet:

```javascript
// ...

export default class World
{
    // ...

    update()
    {
        if(this.fox)
            this.fox.update()
    }
}
```

In the `Fox` class, retrieve the `Time` class because we are going to need the elapsed time, and then create the `update` method in which you update the [AnimationMixer](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=mixer#api/en/animation/AnimationMixer):

```javascript
// ...

export default class Fox
{
    constructor()
    {
        // ...

        this.time = this.experience.time

        // ...
    }

    // ...

    update()
    {
        this.animation.mixer.update(this.time.delta * 0.001)
    }
}
```

The fox should be animated.

And it seems that we are done, but we forgot something.

## Debug [02:44:04](#)[](#debug)

We are missing a very important part, the debug UI.

### Adding the class[](#adding-the-class)

Create a `Debug` class in `/src/Experience/Utils/`:

```javascript
export default class Debug
{
    constructor()
    {
        
    }
}
```

In the `Experience` class, instantiate it before any other class:

```javascript
// ...

import Debug from './Utils/Debug.js'

// ...

export default class Experience
{
    constructor(canvas)
    {
        // ...

        // Setup
        this.debug = new Debug()
        this.sizes = new Sizes()
        this.time = new Time()
        
        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```

Instead of always having the debug UI, we are going to let the user choose to have it.

If the user has accessed the URL with `#debug` at the end, they will have the debug UI. Otherwise, no debug UI.

This is handy because most users will access the website without seeing the UI, but users that know what they are doing (like you as the developer) can access the UI without having to rebuild the project.

To test the presence of `#debug` in the URL, we can use `window.location.hash`:

```javascript
export default class Debug
{
    constructor()
    {
        this.active = window.location.hash === '#debug'
    }
}
```

If it's the case, we instantiate lil-gui in the `ui` property. Don't forget to import `lil-gui`:

```javascript
import GUI from 'lil-gui'

export default class Debug
{
    constructor()
    {
        this.active = window.location.hash === '#debug'

        if(this.active)
        {
            this.ui = new GUI()
        }
    }
}
```

Access the URL by adding `#debug` at the end. Be careful, when changing or adding a `#` to a URL, most browsers will not refresh automatically and you'll have to do it yourself.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1792 1120'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

The debug UI should appear in the top right corner.

### Debug the Fox[](#debug-the-fox)

Let's start with the fox. As a little bonus, we are going to create three debug buttons that let us play the three different animations of the model.

First, in the `Fox` class, retrieve the `Debug` class and, if `debug.active` is `true`, create a folder:

```javascript
// ...

export default class Fox
{
    constructor()
    {
        // ...

        this.debug = this.experience.debug

        // Debug
        if(this.debug.active)
        {
            this.debugFolder = this.debug.ui.addFolder('fox')
        }

        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```

In the `setAnimation` method, we are going to make some changes.

First, let's create all three actions available in `this.resource.animations` and save them in an `actions` property:

```javascript
// ...

export default class Fox
{
    // ...

    setAnimation()
    {
        this.animation = {}
        
        this.animation.mixer = new THREE.AnimationMixer(this.model)
        
        this.animation.actions = {}
        
        this.animation.actions.idle = this.animation.mixer.clipAction(this.resource.animations[0])
        this.animation.actions.walking = this.animation.mixer.clipAction(this.resource.animations[1])
        this.animation.actions.running = this.animation.mixer.clipAction(this.resource.animations[2])
    }

    // ...
}
```

Then, we save one of them in the `current` property and play it:

```javascript
// ...

export default class Fox
{
    // ...

    setAnimation()
    {
        this.animation = {}
        
        this.animation.mixer = new THREE.AnimationMixer(this.model)
        
        this.animation.actions = {}
        
        this.animation.actions.idle = this.animation.mixer.clipAction(this.resource.animations[0])
        this.animation.actions.walking = this.animation.mixer.clipAction(this.resource.animations[1])
        this.animation.actions.running = this.animation.mixer.clipAction(this.resource.animations[2])
        
        this.animation.actions.current = this.animation.actions.idle
        this.animation.actions.current.play()
    }

    // ...
}
```

We should get the same result, but now, we have access to the `walking` and `running` animations.

When playing a new animation for the model, we want a smooth transition. To do that, we can use one of the many methods available in the [AnimationAction](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=actio#api/en/animation/AnimationAction.crossFadeFrom) class.

We are going to use `crossFadeFrom(...)`. This method needs to be called on the incoming action, with the previous action as the first parameter and the duration of the transition (in seconds) as the second parameter. We also need to reset and play the new animation.

We are going to put those instructions in a new method. In the `animation` property, create a `play` method:

```javascript
this.animation.play = (name) =>
{
}
```

In that `play` method, define the previous and the new actions:

```javascript
this.animation.play = (name) =>
{
    const newAction = this.animation.actions[name]
    const oldAction = this.animation.actions.current
}
```

Then, reset the new one, play it and do a `crossFadeFrom(...)`:

```javascript
this.animation.play = (name) =>
{
    const newAction = this.animation.actions[name]
    const oldAction = this.animation.actions.current

    newAction.reset()
    newAction.play()
    newAction.crossFadeFrom(oldAction, 1)
}
```

Finally, save the new action in the `current` property, so that, next time we call our `play` function, it will crossfade from that action to the new one:

```javascript
this.animation.play = (name) =>
{
    const newAction = this.animation.actions[name]
    const oldAction = this.animation.actions.current

    newAction.reset()
    newAction.play()
    newAction.crossFadeFrom(oldAction, 1)

    this.animation.actions.current = newAction
}
```

Theoretically, our code should work. But is there a way to test it without adding the buttons to the debug UI?

Remember that we put the experience in a global variable named `experience`. This means that, in the console, we can type:

```javascript
window.experience.world.fox.animation.play('walking')
```

And you should see the fox starting to walk.

We can now add the debug buttons to our `fox` debug folder.

Remember that lil-gui needs the value to be available as a property. Unfortunately, we can't just add the `this.animation.play` function to lil-gui because we also need to send the name of the action to play.

We are going to use a `debugObject` and put in three functions with each one calling `this.animation.play` with the corresponding parameter:

```javascript
// ...

export default class Fox
{
    // ...

    setAnimation()
    {
        // ...

        // Debug
        if(this.debug.active)
        {
            const debugObject = {
                playIdle: () => { this.animation.play('idle') },
                playWalking: () => { this.animation.play('walking') },
                playRunning: () => { this.animation.play('running') }
            }
            this.debugFolder.add(debugObject, 'playIdle')
            this.debugFolder.add(debugObject, 'playWalking')
            this.debugFolder.add(debugObject, 'playRunning')
        }
    }

    // ...
}
```

We can now test the different animations right from our debug UI.

### Debug the environment[](#debug-the-environment)

For the purposes of this lesson and to make sure that we can use the debug UI, let's add some tweaks to the environment.

In the `Environment` class, retrieve the `Debug` and, if `active`, add a folder:

```javascript
// ...

export default class Environment
{
    constructor()
    {
        // ...

        this.debug = this.experience.debug
        
        // Debug
        if(this.debug.active)
        {
            this.debugFolder = this.debug.ui.addFolder('environment')
        }

        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1792 1120'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

You should see the `environment` debug folder.

In the `setEnvironment` function, add a tweak for `intensity` to that folder and don't forget to call the `this.environmentMap.updateMaterials` method that we prepared earlier when the value changes:

```javascript
// ...

export default class Environment
{
    // ...

    setEnvironmentMap()
    {
        // ...

        // Debug
        if(this.debug.active)
        {
            this.debugFolder
                .add(this.environmentMap, 'intensity')
                .name('envMapIntensity')
                .min(0)
                .max(4)
                .step(0.001)
                .onChange(this.environmentMap.updateMaterials)
        }
    }
}
```

We can now tweak the environment map intensity and all children of the scene are being updated properly.

Let's do the same with the `sunLight` and add tweaks to control the `intensity`, `position.x`, `position.y` and `position.z`:

```javascript
// ...

export default class Environment
{
    // ...

    setSunLight()
    {
        // ...

        // Debug
        if(this.debug.active)
        {
            this.debugFolder
                .add(this.sunLight, 'intensity')
                .name('sunLightIntensity')
                .min(0)
                .max(10)
                .step(0.001)
            
            this.debugFolder
                .add(this.sunLight.position, 'x')
                .name('sunLightX')
                .min(- 5)
                .max(5)
                .step(0.001)
            
            this.debugFolder
                .add(this.sunLight.position, 'y')
                .name('sunLightY')
                .min(- 5)
                .max(5)
                .step(0.001)
            
            this.debugFolder
                .add(this.sunLight.position, 'z')
                .name('sunLightZ')
                .min(- 5)
                .max(5)
                .step(0.001)
        }
    }

    // ...
}
```

We can now tweak the light.

## Destroying [03:07:18](#)[](#destroying)

At some point, you might need to destroy parts of your experience, or even the whole thing. It could be because the animation is done, the player moved to another level, the WebGL isn't visible anymore or maybe the fox ran away.

We could leave things as they are, but that is bad for performances. We have functions being called on each frame, we have textures on the GPU, we have listeners, etc.

In this section, we are going to destroy the whole experience and make sure to dispose of things properly.

### Stopping time and resize events[](#stopping-time-and-resize-events)

First, let's add a destroy method to our `Experience` class. This method will stop listening to the `Time` and `Sizes` events with `off()`:

```javascript
// ...

export default class Experience
{
    // ...

    destroy()
    {
        this.sizes.off('resize')
        this.time.off('tick')
    }
}
```

`off()` is part of the `EventEmitter` class and will remove every listener attached to the instance.

To test it, we can call `window.experience.destroy()` in the browser console.

The animation should stop because we are not listening to the `tick` event anymore and our `update()` function isn't being called.

### Dispose of everything in the scene[](#dispose-of-everything-in-the-scene)

We are now going to traverse the scene and look for the things that we want to dispose.

First, let's use the `traverse()` function on the scene:

```javascript
// ...

export default class Experience
{
    // ...

    destroy()
    {
        this.sizes.off('resize')
        this.time.off('tick')

        // Traverse the whole scene
        this.scene.traverse((child) =>
        {
            console.log(child)
        })
    }
}
```

You should see every child of the scene (even children of children) being logged in the console.

If you refer to the Three.js documentation ([How to dispose of objects](https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/How-to-dispose-of-objects)), you will see that we need to dispose of geometries, materials, textures and then specific things like controls, passes, etc.

Here's how we are going to proceed for each child:

*   Test if it's a [Mesh](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=mesh#api/en/objects/Mesh).
*   Call the `dispose()` function on the `geometry` property.
*   Loop through every key of the `material` property.
*   If there is a `dispose()` function available on that key, call it.

This way, we don't need to test every possible map of the material in order for all the textures and geometries in the scene to be disposed:

```javascript
// ...

export default class Experience
{
    // ...

    destroy()
    {
        this.sizes.off('resize')
        this.time.off('tick')

        // Traverse the whole scene
        this.scene.traverse((child) =>
        {
            // Test if it's a mesh
            if(child instanceof THREE.Mesh)
            {
                child.geometry.dispose()

                // Loop through the material properties
                for(const key in child.material)
                {
                    const value = child.material[key]

                    // Test if there is a dispose function
                    if(value && typeof value.dispose === 'function')
                    {
                        value.dispose()
                    }
                }
            }
        })
    }
}
```

This is a very minimalist way of destroying everything in a scene. You might find that there will be exceptions within specific classes, but our attempt here is to keep things as simple as possible.

### Dispose of the controls[](#dispose-of-the-controls)

There is a bit more cleaning up to do. The camera doesn't need to be disposed, but the [OrbitControls](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=controls#examples/en/controls/OrbitControls.dispose) do:

```javascript
// ...

export default class Experience
{
    // ...

    destroy()
    {
        // ...

        this.camera.controls.dispose()
    }
}
```

### Dispose of the Renderer[](#dispose-of-the-renderer)

The [WebGLRenderer](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=webglre#api/en/renderers/WebGLRenderer.dispose) also has a dispose method and we can call it without needing to look too deeply into it.

```javascript
// ...

export default class Experience
{
    // ...

    destroy()
    {
        // ...
        this.renderer.instance.dispose()
    }
}
```

Be careful, if you are using post-processing, you'll need to dispose of the [EffectComposer](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/postprocessing/EffectComposer), its [WebGLRenderTarget](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=rendertar#api/en/renderers/WebGLRenderTarget) and any potential passes you are using.

### Dispose of the debug[](#dispose-of-the-debug)

We are using lil-gui as the Debug UI which is quite easy to destroy. All we need to do is call its `destroy()` method, but we need to make sure that the debug is currently active before doing so:

```javascript
// ...

export default class Experience
{
    // ...

    destroy()
    {
        // ...
        if(this.debug.active)
            this.debug.ui.destroy()
    }
}
```

And that's all. You can now call `window.experience.destroy()` in the console.

### Warning and further disposing[](#warning-and-further-disposing)

As you can see, destroying things is a bit tricky. You'll have to dive into the different components you've used and make sure you are disposing of everything properly.

We didn't remove the `<canvas>` and the last frame is still rendered in it, but you can remove from the page if you need.

Be aware that when we stopped listening to the `Sizes` and `Time` events, those classes will still be listening to native events. This is not a big deal, but if you are a little picky, you can also handle disposing of them as well.

One more thing to acknowledge is that we wrote everything in the same `destroy()` method for the sake of simplicity. If you have a more complex project with a lot to destroy, you may want to create a `destroy()` method for each class that needs it. This way, the experience would propagate the `destroy()` to its children as we did for the `update()` and `resize()` methods.

## Summary [03:18:20](#)[](#summary)

Structuring code with modules and classes might look hard and counterproductive at first, but a real-life Three.js project can end up being so huge that you better not have spaghetti code if you want to get that project done right.

Having these separate classes is also great for reusing them with other projects. Most of the `Utils` classes we created can be reused without doing anything to them.

Structuring code also creates a good environment in which to work with other developers and limit conflicts. Each developer can work on a specific class.

Many of the decisions we made during this lesson are specific to my personal preferences. You should work on your structure and create a template so that you can start working on a new project more quickly. Don't hesitate to share that structure with others.
